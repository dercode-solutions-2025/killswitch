It all started when I hopped on TF2. I wanted variety to my game. I downloaded a mod, to no avail. Don't know why it didn't work. Went to GameBanana, found the SAME mod, had NO VIRUS WARNING, downloaded it.
I got a Trojan Horse malware. I had to delete all of my apps, files, saves, everything. Windows 11 is a great OS and all, but try for once. AVG works, but it's paid. I need to add free virus protection for all.
So, here comes KILLSWITCH 1.0, my first edition of a watchdog, I tried, and it should work. I don't have full certainty, because of my limited experience with this, but it will work. It searches for keywords like "trojan" or "malware", among others.
It asks if you want to delete it, and it saves its kills as trophies in a .json file, and references accomplishments on startup. As a bonus, it remembers your name, so that's cool I guess.
Anyways, have fun with KILLSWITCH and it's abilities. Goodbye, good luck. To test it, put it in a blank folder with a file of any extension, just make sure the name fits one of the keywords.
It saves the quarantined file in an extension so encrypted, it will take NASA supercomputers decades to decipher a SINGULAR DIGIT. Why? So nobody can open the encrypted file from an external source, I figured they will have to guess the file name to get to it.
Another thing, the hackers have to guess the name AND extension. KILLSWITCH's files are also encrypted with an AES encryption system created by the United States government, you know them, only the most SECURE, PRIVATE, POWERFUL country to exist since 1776.
AES was created in 2001, developed in 1998, but don't undermine it. It is used by finance agenices, government agencies (to protect files, that when leaked, compromise the entire infrastructure of the United States, and so they must be safe.), AES is also used by telecom agencies.
AES is a similar system to our system, unreadable files, blah blah blah safe, bullshit. Think of boring safes like CCleaner and AVG anti as a high-caliber rifle. They can severely injure and/or kill you, not to mention cause permanent paralysis. Now that you have that idea, KILLSWITCH is the German-made, Krupp Dora, Gustav Gun.
KILLSWITCH also sports a nice ASCII banner and kill count. It also has every possible malware name, in the dozens.
